    <p class='mainFont fontItalic'>For What We Do</p>
    <p class='mainFont'>
    Our company’s rich history began only 2 years ago in our founder’s garage. In those times Crossman Enterprises sourced from a third party vendor and acted as a middle man for the resale of foreign laborers. This was not a permeant solution so our founder quickly made powerful contacts during these first few months and began to form what would become a heavy competitor to the stagnant human trafficking business. Crossman Enterprises would go on to blindside the big three with our rapid growth and low prices. 
    </P>
    <p class='mainFont'>
    Low prices does not mean low quality. Crossman Enterprises prides itself in our high quality workers and un-beatable prices and warranty. We are now at the end of our transition period to becoming a fully self-sustaining company by 2021. Crossman Enterprises ethically sources and ships all of our products without any third parties, and we couldn’t be happier to announce that we are a carbon neutral company. Using John D. Rockefeller as an inspiration, our vertical integration over the entire process allows us to undercut our competitors by significant margins, without sacrificing quality. 
    </p>

    Our customers come first at Crossman Enterprises and that is why we offer the best warranty on the market. Rest assured with your purchase knowing that you have 5 years to return or exchange your product if you are not 100% satisfied. We take security and discreteness very seriously here, and that is why we offer fully anonymous purchases and consolation. Our customer satisfaction ratings are industry leading and we only have more incentives planned. 
    </p>
    <p class='mainFont'>
    Crossman Enterprises takes pride in our wide variety of products and services. From the basic laborer to our state-of-the-art Jeaxi Stadium under South Mountain, we offer everything you could possibly want to stay productive and have fun. We have many new and exciting services and products launching this quarter and cannot wait to share them with you!
    </p>

    We want to thank our partners for helping pave the way for a new golden age of slave trade; Diego Go Mail, Tyler’s Athletics, and Wyatt’s Wacky Medicine. Remember for any of your human trafficking needs, think Crossman Enterprises!
